# House-Prices

This project contains all the work I have put into predicting house for the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
Kaggle competition. This project consists of the training and test sets provided by Kaggle, aswell as the 
House Prices Exploration Jupyter notebook which contains the bulk of my data analysis. I also created a document that
analyzed each feature in order to figure out what how to treat each feature.
